<p>How many doughnuts can you feed?</p>
<p>You have to feed a person or you lose, but be careful there are bombs among the food that can harm both the table and the person, so quickly dump them off the table, but it's better to dump donuts up, right into the person's mouth. The more donuts you feed in one game, the more appearances will be available for your character. Try to open all the appearances, and then compete with your friends, comparing your maximum records. At the moment, only 1 mode is implemented in the game, but soon their number will increase.</p>
